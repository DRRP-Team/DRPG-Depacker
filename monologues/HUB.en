Welcome to Junction, Marine.
Most of the people that survivedthe attack haveregrouped here.

X Dr. Jensen gotcanned due tosome securityissues.
I'm notsure what thatwas all about.l 
I used to workwith Mr. Nadirain bioresearch.He was a niceguy, until hestarted workingwith Dr. Guerard.N We're screwed. 
Itis only a matterof time beforethe monstersenter Junction.Junction is anarea that inter
connects the dif
ferent areas ofthe base. Thecorridors anddoors in Junctionlead to all themajor sectorswithin this fa
cility. Some pas
sages in Junctionare locked andrequire high
level securityclearance to en
ter. You be careful.[ Ever heard ofKronos? Never methim but logs showhe has extremelyhigh securityclearance. Hold me!l You can acquiresupplies andmedical treatmenthere. Inquirewith the northwing staff formore information.w This door leadsto the reactorpowering this fa
cility. Top
levelsecurity clear
ance is requiredto enter thisarea.4 It's my duty toguard this post.Orders from UACHQ.. I can't let youin without propercredentials.: Sorry, under or
ders. No go with
out proper clear
ance. No.B You really wantin? How about wemake a deal? Got100 UAC credits?= No deal. Changedmy mind. Get thered keycard ifyou want in.4 Use the computerto the left topurchase sup
plies._ Find UAC creditslying round thebase and use themto purchase use
ful provisions atJunction.–∫ Many of the itemsfound around thisbase are self
explanatory, buta few require ex
planation. TheSoul Sphere re
stores your armorand health tomaximum. The Ber
serker increasesyour attackbriefly. Theseare one
time useitems.#You can buy statboosters at avending machinecomputer. Theseincrease your De
fense, Agility,Strength, and Ac
curacy. Defenseis your resis
tance to attacks.Agility is yourability to evadeattacks. Strengthis the damage youcan inflict. Ac
curacy is yourability to landan attack.H Seems stupid forthe UAC to becharging a Marinefor combat equip
ment.. I'm a doctor, re
lax. I'll dressyour wounds. Health restored. Feeling better?2 Come see me anytime you needmedical atten
tion.? Use the Medkitsin your inventoryif you're hurtduring combat.^ Sorry Marine,this area is offlimits. Dr. Gue
rard ordered aquarantine ofthe reactor area.{ This passageleads to Sector2. You are wel
come to try itout but youshould probablytry playingthrough Sector 1first.‚Äû This passageleads to Sector3. You shouldconsider complet
ing Sector 2 be
fore enteringSector 3. Buthey, do whateveryou want. Don't know whybut my col
leagues, Dr. Jen
sen and Dr. Gue
rard, have it outfor each other. Idon't trust ei
ther of them!–ä I heard Dr. Gue
rard got Dr. Jen
sen fired. Notsure I believethat though. Ithink Jensen wasjust sloppy withhis security pro
cedures. Kronos is goingto kill us all!f Rumor is thatJensen was firedfor securitybreaches butGuerard may havehad something todo with it.G Have you met Kro
nos? I've beenhere for yearsbut have nevermet him.; Lots of equipmenthas disappeared.Hope it turns upintact.+ The scientists atthis facility areinsane!l Oh, you have theblue keycard?Jensen had itwhen we arrestedhim. Hope Guerarddoesn't comelooking for it.r Someone told methey saw Guerardtransform intosome kind of hor
rible creature. Iwonder what thatis all about." I don't know whoto trust anymore.` I won't tell any
one you have thecard. I don'ttrust Guerard.I'd rather youhave it than him.A I'm beginning towonder if anyonewill make it outof here alive.¬¶ I was working inSector 5 as partof the unit thatarrested Dr. Jen
sen. I rememberhe was fired sev
eral weeks ago soI'm not sure whyhe's still atthis facility.E I need to getinto the greenzone but I mis
placed my greenkeycard.@ You found mygreen keycard!Keep it. You needit more than Ido.F I'm freaked. Ihave a feelingsomething reallybad is about tohappen.L Guerard went downto the reactor. Ihope he can putan end to thisinvasion!@ I think I left mygreen keycard inSector 3, in theyellow zone. Good luck,Marine.< I can't getthrough the greendoor without mygreen keycard.F You have yellowsecurity clear
ance. Proceedthrough theyellow door.s I worked withGuerard andJensen on theteleportation re
search team.Those two reallyhave it out foreach other.( My feet hurt fromstanding here solong.i I have a reallybad feeling aboutGuerard. Betweenus, I think heis the one re
sponsible forthis mess.a Search the basefor additionalcolored keycardswhich allow ac
cess to more ar
eas in Junction.Jensen got firedover a securitymatter. Rumor isthat Guerard gothim fired thoughJensen did noth
ing wrong. Idon't believe it.Dr. Guerard wasan outstandingemployee, puttingin extra hours atnight and be
friending UAC ad
ministrators.He's a nice guy.¬´ The red keycardis the highestlevel of securityclearance 
 itallows access tothe reactor areawhich houses thepower plant pro
viding energy tothe entire facil
ity.W I heard Jensen isstill on base in
vestigating hisfiring. Hope heuncovers thetruth.¬± These doors leadto various areasof the base. Ineach subsequentsector the jour
ney gets harder.Since the moreyou fight thestronger you get,stick to the easyareas first.–ã Seems you'vecleared Sector 3and acquired agreen keycard.Continue yourmission by head
ing to the greenzone and clearingSectors 4 and 5.\ We won't make itmuch longer. It'sonly a matter oftime before themonsters enterJunction.F I heard Nadiragot eaten by amonster. No loss.I never likedthe guy.N You will be takenback to Junctionshould you getincapacitatedduring combat.~ Not sure how longwe'll last hereat Junction. Mon
sters have takenover every otherpart of the baseand we need sup
plies.A You can replay asector severaltimes to build upyour abilities.—ì Good to see youmade it. Yourcurrent objectiveis to seek infor
mation on thecause of this in
vasion and find away to stop it.‚Äò I don't trustGuerard and Idon't think youshould either.I've heard thathe's working withKronos and thatthey're responsi
ble for thismess.O It's only a mat
ter of time be
fore the demonsoverrun the en
tire planet..._ What? The mainreactor is backonline? I hopethey aren'tplanning on re
opening the por
tal.c You'll need addi
tional coloredkeycards to gainaccess to all theareas accessiblefrom Junction.7 Trust your in
stincts. It's theonly way to sur
vive.–Ü Bioscans indicatethe monsters arecoming from theunderground reac
tor sector.Strange... howcould they be in
vading from ageothermic reac
tor deep inside aMartian cavern?p You know what toexpect: more sec
tor doors to ex
plore in the huntfor the next col
ored keycard. Getto it!>A lot of the sci
entists look EX
ACTLY like me.Why you may ask?Is this outpostsome cloning fa
cility or are thegame designerstoo lazy to cre
ate a variety ofcharacters? Or isit something moreinsidious, likeextremely smallmemory con
straints forportable devicesthat won't allowmuch graphicalvariety?!~ Have you noticedthat if you keeptalking to peoplehere they maketrite insidejokes and othermisguided at
tempts at humor?Ever hear of Kro
nos? He was a UACscientist workingon teleportationresearch yearsago. It's saidthat he traveledfrom our dimen
sion to one ofpure evil wherehe fused humantechnology withdemonic flesh,creating a newsuper weapon. UACfired Kronos andburied the re
search but rumorhas it thatKronos is on thisbase trying tobring his crea
tion into our di
mension.f If you comeacross him, stophim. Be careful,Kronos is con
trolling theminds of UACadministrators.—ñ I think Kronosmoved theteleportation re
search equipmentinto the reactorcore and plans touse the massiveof the reactorcore to movesomething verylarge into ourdimension.9 Hey, by theway, you didn'thear any of thisfrom me, OK?—ç The Union Aero
space Corporationwelcomes you toJunction. Hereyou have accessto clean, quietliving conditionswith all the lat
est amenities,such as combatequipment vendingand medical fa
cilities. Thinkof Junction asyour home awayfrom home.= The UAC strivesto be a safe andfriendly work en
vironment.[Email]From: J. RaphaelTo: M. RossMatt, I've beentransferred to aunit in charge ofmoving a bunch ofmachinery fromthe labs to thereactor sector.Not sure whatthat's all aboutbut I won't beable to make ourDDR party to
night. I have towork overtime.TTYL. 
Jah[Email]From: J. RaphaelTo: M. RossDude, the inva
sion happened aday after all thestuff from thelabs were movedto the reactorsector. Not surewhat's going onbut I think Gue
rard may have hada hand in this.Heard that Guer
ard ordered themove. 
Jah  Segment Fault:G_3R4%D 15 K&0N^5 System offline.—ä [Email]From: M. RossTo: J. RaphaelMan, lots ofweird things aregoing on. I'vebeen workingcrazy hours atthe machine shopbut nobody tellsme what I'm work
ing on. I have astrange feelingit has to do withwhat's going onat the reactor.
Matt No more email.‚Äπ [Email]From: Col. GraffTo: D. WhitlarkWhitlark, whereare the reportsyou promised me?You said they'dbe done by Tues
day!
Col. GraffINCOMING TEXTMESSAGE:HELP! I'm beingheld against mywill in Sector 5.They've taken myblue keycard andweapon! I have mycell phone butthe battery isabout to die andthis is the lasttext message I'llbe able to send.Someone pleasehelp me!
Dr. Jensen5[Email]From: D. WhitlarkTo: Col. GraffSorry sir. I wasa little dis
tracted. I dis
covered an oldcomputer gamecalled DOOM...it has to be atleast 100 yearsold but it'sstill surpris
ingly addictive.The weird thingis that the set
ting and scenarioof the game issimilar to ours.Funny, eh?
DavidT [Email]From: Col. GraffTo: D. WhitlarkJust get me thedamned reports!
Col. Graff‚Ä∞ [Email]From: D. WhitlarkTo: Col. GraffYes sir! You'llhave them today.BTW, they're mak
ing DOOM for thecell phone. Cool,eh?
David–ï Log Entry ofDr. Jensen:*CLASSIFIED*Our budget hasbeen increased tofund the study ofmatter transpor
tation. We hopeto have a func
tional prototypeready for demon
stration in a fewmonths.¬Æ Log Entry ofDr. Guerard:*CLASSIFIED*Seems that mycolleague, Dr.Jensen, has beenfired over somepetty securitymatters. It's un
fortunate; he wasa skilled scien
tist.—ä [Email]To: B. SmithFrom: K. SimonsDr. Jensen had meinvestigate Dr.Guerard's employ
ment history.What I found wasstrange. Guerardwas supposedlyhired onto theteleportation re
search team 2years ago butUACHQ has no rec
ord of him.
Karina–™ Log Entry ofDr. Jensen:*CLASSIFIED*Dr. Guerard saysthe electricalrequirements ofour device ex
ceeded his ini
tial estimations.We will likelyhave to move thedevice to a loca
tion with alarger energysource.–π Log Entry ofDr. Guerard:*CLASSIFIED*With Mr. Nadira'sassistance, I wasable to convinceCol. Graff tomove our equip
ment from the labto the reactor.This move shouldhelp meet theenergy demands ofour next set ofexperiments.¬ò [Email]To: K. SimonsFrom: B. SmithWell, the UAC isa huge bureauc
racy with bil
lions of records.They're bound tolose one once ina while.
